        "# Independent Validation of N-linked Glycosylation Penetrance in Antibody Variable Domains: Refutation of the Glutamine Blocker Rule and Discovery of Chain-Specific Effects\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Machine learning tools for *de novo* antibody design—including RFdiffusion, RF Antibody, and related structure prediction methods—have fundamentally transformed the early stages of therapeutic development. These tools excel at generating novel sequences with desired structural and binding properties, but they operate in a world of idealized protein structures that ignores a critical biological reality: post-translational modifications. Among these, N-linked glycosylation represents perhaps the most consequential blind spot.\n",
        "\n",
        "N-linked glycosylation occurs at the canonical sequon N-X-S/T, where X is any residue except proline. While conserved Fc-region glycosylation at position N297 is well-characterized and functionally important, glycosylation within variable domains (VH/VL) is typically undesirable. Variable domain glycosylation can cause heterogeneous glycoform populations that complicate purification and analytical characterization, altered binding kinetics through steric interference with epitope engagement, reduced thermostability and increased aggregation propensity, potential immunogenicity from non-human glycan structures when expressed in CHO or other non-human hosts, and batch-to-batch variability that challenges manufacturing consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "The prevalence of variable domain glycosylation in natural antibody repertoires was characterized by van de Bovenkamp and colleagues (2016), who demonstrated that approximately 15-25% of circulating IgG molecules carry Fab-region glycans. Crucially, these sites arise primarily through somatic hypermutation (SHM) during affinity maturation—the AID-mediated diversification process that optimizes antibody binding. SHM hotspot motifs (RGYW/WRCY) can mutate to generate N-X-S/T sequons, and when these acquired glycans enhance binding affinity or stability, they are positively selected. This means that Fab glycosylation in natural antibodies is often functionally relevant: the glycan contributes to the antibody's evolved properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "This biology creates a specific problem for ML-designed antibodies. Structure prediction tools may generate sequences containing N-X-S/T motifs—either by chance or because they appear in training data—but without the selection pressure that shaped natural repertoires. An ML-designed CDR might contain a sequon that, in its natural context, was selected *because* of its glycan, but the ML tool has no knowledge of this. Conversely, ML tools might introduce sequons in contexts where glycosylation would be detrimental to the intended function. The penetrance rules that govern whether a sequon actually becomes glycosylated are therefore critical for triaging ML outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "The challenge is that sequon presence does not guarantee glycosylation. Penetrance—the probability that a sequon actually acquires a glycan—varies dramatically based on sequence and structural context. The most comprehensive prior analysis of this phenomenon was published by Melo-Braga and colleagues (2024), who curated 752 sequons from 6,709 PDB structures and derived several predictive rules, most notably the \"H/Q blocker rule\": histidine or glutamine at the X-position purportedly blocks glycosylation completely (0/17 observed).\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the Melo-Braga study has methodological limitations that affect the reliability of its conclusions. Their dataset was curated specifically to identify structures containing variable domain glycosylation, introducing ascertainment bias that inflates penetrance estimates (35.1% overall vs. expected population rates). The glutamine blocker claim was based on only 11 sequons—insufficient statistical power to rule out low-frequency glycosylation. Furthermore, VH and VL chains were pooled, N-X-S and N-X-T sequons were pooled, and regional interactions with X-residue identity were not systematically examined.\n",
        "\n",
        "We undertook an independent validation study with three primary objectives: first, to test the H/Q blocker rule with substantially greater statistical power; second, to characterize previously unexplored effects including chain type (VH vs. VL), third position identity (serine vs. threonine), and regional context; and third, to generate empirically-validated risk tables suitable for implementation in glycosylation scanning tools. Our analysis of 19,265 PDB structures containing 2,203 variable domain sequons reveals that glutamine is not an absolute blocker—with direct implications for how ML-designed antibodies should be evaluated for manufacturability liabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dataset Assembly\n",
        "\n",
        "#### PDB Query Strategy\n",
        "\n",
        "We queried the RCSB Protein Data Bank using the following criteria: source organism *Homo sapiens* (taxonomy ID 9606), molecule type matching \"antibody,\" \"immunoglobulin,\" \"Fab,\" or \"scFv\" by full-text search, experimental method either X-ray diffraction or electron microscopy, and resolution ≤3.5 Å. This query returned 19,268 structures as of the analysis date, of which 19,265 were successfully downloaded in mmCIF format.\n",
        "\n",
        "This query strategy deliberately differs from Melo-Braga's approach. Rather than searching for structures containing glycosylation, we retrieved all human antibody structures meeting resolution criteria—an approach that introduces the opposite ascertainment bias. Crystallographers actively select against glycosylated proteins due to conformational heterogeneity, so our observed penetrance (5.1%) represents a conservative lower bound while Melo-Braga's (35.1%) represents an enriched upper bound. True population penetrance likely lies between these values.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Sequon Extraction and Classification\n",
        "\n",
        "For each structure, we parsed mmCIF files using BioPython to extract protein sequences, identified all N-X-S/T sequons where X ≠ P, and detected glycosylation by searching for covalently linked carbohydrate residues (NAG, MAN, BMA, FUC, GAL, SIA) within 2.0 Å of the asparagine Nδ atom using the gemmi library for coordinate access. Chains were classified as antibody variable domains by sequence pattern matching, then assigned IMGT universal numbering using ANARCII 2.0.3 (Antibody Numbering and Receptor ClassIfication). Domain type (VH, Vκ, Vλ) was determined from ANARCII output, with Vκ and Vλ pooled as \"VL\" for analysis. Regional classification followed standard IMGT definitions: FR1 (positions 1-26), CDR1 (27-38), FR2 (39-55), CDR2 (56-65), FR3 (66-104), CDR3 (105-117), and FR4 (118-128).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Dataset Decontamination\n",
        "\n",
        "To ensure findings were not artifacts of re-analyzing data already present in Melo-Braga's dataset, we created a \"decontaminated\" subset by excluding all PDB identifiers appearing in their Supplementary Table 1A. This yielded 322 independent PDB structures containing 903 VH/VL sequons with 33 glycosylation events (3.7% penetrance). Critically, both observed glutamine glycosylation events occur in this independent dataset, demonstrating that our central finding—refutation of the Q blocker rule—is not an artifact of dataset overlap.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Dataset Summary\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### Statistical Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Frequentist Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "We used Fisher's exact test for 2×2 contingency tables comparing penetrance between groups, with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Wilson score intervals were calculated for binomial proportions, which provide more accurate coverage than Wald intervals at extreme proportions. All tests were two-sided with α = 0.05.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Bayesian Hierarchical Model\n",
        "\n",
        "For the H/Q blocker analysis, frequentist methods face the \"zero problem\"—H shows 0/81 glycosylated, making point estimates unstable. We employed Bayesian logistic regression using PyMC v5.10 to estimate penetrance with proper uncertainty quantification. The model structure was:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\text{logit}(p_i) = \\alpha + \\beta_H \\cdot I(X=H) + \\beta_Q \\cdot I(X=Q) + \\beta_{VL} \\cdot I(\\text{chain}=VL) + \\beta_{Q \\times VL} \\cdot I(X=Q) \\cdot I(\\text{chain}=VL)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $I(\\cdot)$ denotes the indicator function. Priors were weakly informative: $\\alpha \\sim \\text{Normal}(-3, 1)$ reflecting expected low baseline penetrance, $\\beta_H \\sim \\text{Normal}(-2, 1)$ encoding prior belief in H blocking, $\\beta_Q \\sim \\text{Normal}(-1, 1.5)$ with wider uncertainty given conflicting prior claims, $\\beta_{VL} \\sim \\text{Normal}(0.5, 0.5)$ based on preliminary data suggesting VL elevation, and $\\beta_{Q \\times VL} \\sim \\text{Normal}(0, 1)$ as uninformative for the interaction. We sampled 2,000 posterior draws after 1,000 tuning iterations using NUTS, with convergence assessed by $\\hat{R}$ (all parameters <1.01) and absence of divergent transitions.\n",
        "\n",
        "This Bayesian approach provides direct probability statements—e.g., $P(\\text{Q penetrance} > 1\\% \\mid \\text{data})$—that are more decision-relevant than p-values for assessing blocker status.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Power Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "Post-hoc power analysis was conducted to assess our ability to detect the H/Q blocking effect given observed sample sizes. With 81 H sequons and 79 Q sequons, assuming true penetrance of 0% (complete blocking) versus a baseline of 5%, power to detect a significant effect ($\\alpha = 0.05$) was 67.2%. This highlights that while our sample substantially exceeds Melo-Braga's, definitive conclusions about weak effects require even larger datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Penetrance Calculation\n",
        "\n",
        "Penetrance was calculated as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\text{Penetrance} = \\frac{N_{\\text{glycosylated}}}{N_{\\text{glycosylated}} + N_{\\text{non-glycosylated}}}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where the denominator represents all sequons observed at a given position, region, or with a given X-residue identity, regardless of glycosylation status.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Ascertainment Bias Sensitivity Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "To address structural database bias toward non-glycosylated samples, we modeled adjusted penetrance under the assumption that crystallographers are $k$-fold more likely to solve a structure if it lacks VD glycosylation:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P_{\\text{adjusted}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{observed}} \\cdot k}{P_{\\text{observed}} \\cdot k + (1 - P_{\\text{observed}})}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "We evaluated sensitivity across $k \\in \\{1.5, 2.0, 3.0\\}$ to bracket plausible bias magnitudes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Software and Reproducibility\n",
        "\n",
        "All analyses were performed in Python 3.10 using BioPython 1.81 for structure parsing, Pandas 2.0.3 for data manipulation, SciPy 1.11.3 for statistical tests, PyMC 5.10.0 for Bayesian inference, ArviZ 0.17.0 for posterior diagnostics, and Matplotlib 3.8.2 / Seaborn 0.13.0 for visualization.
