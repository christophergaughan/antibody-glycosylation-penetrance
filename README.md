## The Problem

ML tools like RFdiffusion generate antibody sequences without considering post-translational modifications. Van de Bovenkamp et al. (2016) showed that 15-25% of circulating IgG carries Fab glycosylation, acquired through somatic hypermutation. When ML tools recapitulate these sequons without the evolutionary selection context, the resulting antibodies may have:

- Heterogeneous glycoform populations
- Altered binding kinetics  
- Reduced stability
- Immunogenicity risk
- Manufacturing variability

**This dataset provides the empirical penetrance values needed to triage ML-designed sequences for glycosylation liability.**

## Key Findings

### 1. The H/Q Blocker Rule is Only Half Right

Melo-Braga et al. (2024) claimed both histidine and glutamine at the X-position block glycosylation completely. Our analysis of 19,265 PDB structures shows **Q is not a blocker**:

![X-residue penetrance ranking](x_residue_penetrance_20260127.png)

| X-Residue | Melo-Braga | This Study | Status |
|-----------|------------|------------|--------|
| **H** | 0/6 (0%) | 0/81 (0%) | ✅ Confirmed blocker |
| **Q** | 0/11 (0%) | 2/79 (2.5%) | ❌ **Not a blocker** |
| **I** | Highest | 16.4% | ✅ Confirmed high risk |

---

### 2. Our Dataset is Independent

To ensure this isn't an artifact of re-analyzing Melo-Braga's data, we compared datasets directly:

![Dataset comparison](melo_braga_vs_validation_20260127.png)

**Critical:** Both Q glycosylation events occur in our decontaminated dataset (PDBs not in Melo-Braga's study). The penetrance difference (35% vs 5%) reflects opposite ascertainment biases—they sought glycosylated structures, crystallographers avoid them.

### 3. VL Chains Have Higher Risk Than VH

A novel finding not reported by Melo-Braga:

![Chain type analysis](vh_vs_vl_analysis_20260127.png)

| Chain | Sequons | Glycosylated | Penetrance | 
|-------|---------|--------------|------------|
| VH | 1,511 | 65 | 4.3% |
| VL | 692 | 48 | 6.9% |

**Odds ratio: 0.60 (p = 0.012)** — VL has ~60% higher baseline risk than VH.

### 4. Regional Hotspots with Bias Correction

Framework regions (especially FR1 and FR4) show highest penetrance. Error bars show sensitivity to ascertainment bias correction:

![Regional penetrance](penetrance_by_region_sensitivity_20260127.png)

**Risk hierarchy:** FR1 > FR4 > FR3 >> CDR1 > CDR3 > CDR2 ≈ FR2

## Risk Summary

```
BLOCKED (<1%):     H, P
LOW (1-3%):        K, W, N, G, Y, V, Q(VH)
MODERATE (3-10%):  Q(VL), A, F, S, M, C, T, L
HIGH (10-20%):     D, R, I
EXTREME (>20%):    I in FR1 (40%), position 20 (37%)
```

**Third position effect:** N-X-T (10.2%) >> N-X-S (2.3%) — 4.4× higher risk

## Quick Start

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load penetrance lookup tables
x_residue = pd.read_csv('data/scanner_x_residue_lookup.csv', index_col=0)
region = pd.read_csv('data/scanner_region_lookup.csv', index_col=0)
chain_x = pd.read_csv('data/scanner_chain_x_lookup.csv', index_col=[0,1])

# Check risk for a sequon with X=Q in VL
risk = chain_x.loc[('VL', 'Q'), 'penetrance']  # Returns 0.043 (4.3%)
```
